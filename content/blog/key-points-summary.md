### **Socio-technical systems**

• Socio-technical systems include computer hardware, software and people and are designed to meet some business goal.

• Emergent properties are properties that are characteristic of the system as a whole and not its component parts.

• The systems engineering process includes specification, design, development, integration and testing. System integration is particularly critical.

• Human and organizational factors have a significant effect on the operation of socio-technical systems.

* There are complex interactions between the processes of system procurement, development and operation.
* A legacy system is an old system that continues to provide essential services.

  • Legacy systems include business processes, application software, support software and system hardware.

### Software Processes

* Software processes are the activities involved in producing and evolving a software system.
* • Software process models are abstract representations of these processes.
* • General activities are specification, design and implementation, validation and evolution.
* • Generic process models describe the organisation of software processes. Examples include the waterfall model, evolutionary development and component-based software engineering.
* • Iterative process models describe the software process as a cycle of activities.
* • Requirements engineering is the process of developing a software specification.
* • Design and implementation processes transform the specification to an executable program.
* • Validation involves checking that the system meets to its specification and user needs.
* • Evolution is concerned with modifying the system after it is in use.
* • The Rational Unified Process is a generic process model that separates activities from phases.
* • CASE technology supports software process activities.

### Requirements-Engineering

◇ Requirements for a software system set out what the system should do and define constraints on its operation and implementation.

* ◇ Functional requirements are statements of the services that the system must provide or are descriptions of how some computations must be carried out.
* ◇ Non-functional requirements often constrain the system being developed and the development process being used.
* ◇ They often relate to the emergent properties of the system and therefore apply to the system as a whole.
* ◇ The requirements engineering process is an iterative process that includes requirements elicitation, specification and validation.
* ◇ Requirements elicitation is an iterative process that can be represented as a spiral of activities – requirements discovery, requirements classification and organization, requirements negotiation and requirements documentation.
* ◇ You can use a range of techniques for requirements elicitation including interviews and ethnography. User stories and scenarios may be used to facilitate discussions.
* ◇ Requirements specification is the process of formally documenting the user and system requirements and creating a software requirements document.
* ◇ The software requirements document is an agreed statement of the system requirements. It should be organized so that both system customers and software developers can use it.
* ◇ Requirements validation is the process of checking the requirements for validity, consistency, completeness, realism and verifiability.
* ◇ Business, organizational and technical changes inevitably lead to changes to the requirements for a software system. Requirements management is the process of managing and controlling these changes.
